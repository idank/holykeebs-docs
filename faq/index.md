# FAQ

## About

holykeebs is a tiny store operated from Israel. I just like soldering.

holykeebs specializes in ergonomic split keyboards with pointing devices such as trackballs, touchpads and trackpoints.

## Shipping

### Do you ship globally?

Yes, if you don't see your country in the shipping page, please contact us.

### What shipping methods are available?

We ship to most destinations using FedEx and the post office (this option is called Economy Post), both have tracking. In some remote countries, the post office doesn't have tracking and will only indicate the package has been sent (this option is called Registered Air Mail).

Transit times for FedEx is usually around 5 days, and the post office average is between 10 to 15 days.

If you choose an untracked shipping option, please be aware that shipping times can highly vary. If you're not willing to wait beyond 30 days, which can happen, please use FedEx.

### My order's tracking has not been updating!

This can be a customs issue, port issues, parcel / postal system overload, and many more reasons we cannot influence. Please reach out after you have not seen an about for at least a week.

If your shipping method wasn't FedEx, your package is delivered using the destination country's local postal service. Use the tracking number in your post office systems to get detailed information on its whereabouts.

## Taxes and Duties

Import duties, taxes, and other fees are the responsibility of the customer and are not included. Your local carrier or customs office will notify you upon receiving the shipment if any payment is required.

If you have any questions about how your package was declared, please reach out.

## Warranty and Support

Whether you order a kit or use the build service, we do our best to test everything before shipping. If you discover an issue after unboxing, please reach out and we'll sort it out. For general firmware questions, please use the help-firmware discord channel. Other warranty and support services aren't provided.

We also encourage visiting the larger keyboard communities such as r/ErgoMechKeyboards, r/MechanicalKeyboards, [QMK](https://discord.gg/qmk) / [Low Profile Keyboards](https://discord.gg/j2ekqbkS) discord server.

## Wireless

I'd love to do wireless builds but there isn't official support for the pointing devices we use in ZMK. There are various efforts but those aren't confirmed to fully work or be power efficient.

## Low Profile vs. Choc

The difference between these two is the key spacing, i.e. how close the keys are to each other:

1. MX keyboards use a grid of 19x19mm squares. Some keyboards with choc switches also use this, which results in small gaps between keys.
1. Choc spacing uses 18x17mm squares, and produces a more tight arrangement with minimal key spacing. It is specifically designed for Kailh's choc switches (hence the name).

For choc keyboards, we differentiate these two styles of spacing by calling the former Low Profile and the latter Choc.

## New Keyboards

Every few months I will add new keyboards models or extend the ones already offered with new features. If you have a specific need that you think would also garner interest from others, feel free to reach out and I might be incentivized to go for that next.

## Firmware

### Can I Change Split Master

Yes, see [SPLIT_POINTING_ENABLE](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_pointing_device?id=split-keyboard-configuration).

### Dual Pointing Devices

All combinations are possible except for two trackpoints due to lack of support in QMK.

### Remapping Keys

With VIA, keys and layers can be changed without flashing the keyboard. Go to the VIA [web app](https://usevia.app/), or download the [desktop app](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases). If you don't want to use VIA, please consult QMK docs on how to create your own keymap.

### Trackpoint Calibration

Most trackpoints move the same in all directions, but some may move slower in certain directions. This can be calibrated in firmware by modifying the movement in the misbehaving directions.

This code snippet is a simple solution that bumps the movement for a trackpoint that moves slower in the left and bottom directions. Adjust the multiplier and directions to your need:

```
#define PS2_MOUSE_MULTIPLIER 2

void ps2_mouse_moved_user(report_mouse_t *mouse_report) {
  // Moving left.
  if (mouse_report->x < 0) {
    mouse_report->x *= PS2_MOUSE_MULTIPLIER;
  }
  // Moving down.
  if (mouse_report->y > 0) {
    mouse_report->y *= PS2_MOUSE_MULTIPLIER;
  }
}
```

If this doesn't solve your problem, reach out.

## Hardware: Fasteners, Spacers

All of our keyboards use these screws and spacers.

- Flat head M2 H1.3 hex screws (5mm bottom side, 3mm top side).
- M2 gold spacers (4mm low profile keyboards, 7mm MX keyboards).
- M2 silver spacers for OLED (11mm for low profile sockets, 13mm for machine sockets).

These are common on Aliexpress in case you need to get additional ones (but feel free to reach out if you'd like us to send you some). You may try these links but they're not guaranteed to stay up or be the most affordable option ([screws](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005267980793.html), [gold spacers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004564012666.html), [silver spacers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004416481151.html))
